Introduction:
Azure Active Directory is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service. It serves as a comprehensive identity and authentication platform that allows organizations to manage user identities, access permissions, and security policies. Hybrid identities refer to the integration of on-premises Active Directory with Azure AD, enabling organizations to extend their existing identity infrastructure into the cloud.
On-Premises Active Directory (On-Prem AD):

On-Premises Active Directory, often referred to as just "Active Directory" or "AD," is a Microsoft product and service used by organizations to manage and store information about their network users, devices, and resources. It's typically deployed within an organization's own data centers or on-premises servers.
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD):

Azure Active Directory is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service designed for the cloud era. While it shares some similarities with On-Premises Active Directory, Azure AD is primarily focused on providing identity services for cloud-based applications, services, and resources.
Why it's Important:
Seamless User Experience: Implementing hybrid identities with Azure AD enables users to have a single set of credentials for accessing both on-premises and cloud-based resources. This streamlines the user experience, making it easier for employees to access the tools and data they need.
Enhanced Security: Azure AD offers robust security features, including multi-factor authentication, conditional access policies, and identity protection. By extending these security capabilities to on-premises resources, organizations can improve their overall security posture.
